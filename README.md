# Neural networks 

I was playing around with neural nets to try to understand how they work. Thought to share the code because a good friend of mine told me to: "put any code that you write on github, you'll thank me in 10 years time". 

I used softmax and ReLu activation function, and randomised the weights and biases. Nothing crazy, just wanted to get to know how neural nets operate
